# How to Use the Natal Chart Feature on SkylineReadings

This guide explains how to generate your personalized Natal Chart Report and offers an introduction to what a natal chart is and how to interpret it. A natal chart, also known as a birth chart, is a snapshot of the sky at the exact moment of your birth. It maps the positions of the Sun, Moon, and planets relative to the Earth, and each placement influences your personality, strengths, challenges, and life purpose.

## What is a Natal Chart?

- **Celestial Snapshot:**  
  A natal chart represents the positions of the Sun, Moon, and planets at the moment of your birth. It is divided into 12 houses, each governing different areas of life such as relationships, career, and personal growth.

- **Astrological Symbols:**  
  Every planet is placed in a zodiac sign which colors its influence. For instance, the Sun sign reflects your core identity, while the Moon sign speaks to your inner emotional world. The interactions between these placementsâ€”known as aspectsâ€”offer deeper insights into your potential and challenges.

## How to Read Your Natal Chart

1. **Core Elements:**  
   Begin by identifying your Sun, Moon, and Rising (Ascendant) signs. These are the pillars of your astrological identity and can tell you about your essential self, emotional nature, and how you present yourself to the world.

2. **Understanding the Houses:**  
   The natal chart is divided into 12 houses. Each house represents different life areas:
   - **1st House:** Self-image and appearance
   - **2nd House:** Finances and values  
   - **3rd House:** Communication and immediate environment  
   - *(â€¦and so on for all 12 houses)*

3. **Interpreting Aspects:**  
   Look at the angles between the planets. Conjunctions, squares, trines, and oppositions reveal how different parts of your personality interactâ€”indicating where you might face challenges or enjoy natural talents.

4. **Personal Reflection:**  
   Use the insights to understand your innate traits, plan for future opportunities, and work on overcoming challenges. A natal chart is a tool for self-awareness rather than a fixed destiny.
